# GUI Source Code
The GUI Application written in python language with pyqt framework, we created two standalone applications for running on 
**Windows** and **Mac**, and if you are working on another OS or in case you had problems in GUI Applications, you can 
can run the GUI source code which explained below.
### Windows Users
Easily download the application [here](https://github.com/Azhy-Slemany/kurdish/releases/download/1.0.0/KurdishCharacterConvertor-Windows.zip)
 and unzip it in desired location and then run the `Kurdish Character Convertor` file in the unzipped folder, but 
 becareful don't move the unzipped or extracted folder after running the program because it will break all batch files that are 
 described in the README file, read the readme file and enjoy the application, in case of any problems you can notify as,
and you can also run the program using the source code with python 3 which explained below in __Other OS Type Users or Developers__.
### Macbook Users
Download the application [here](https://github.com/Azhy-Slemany/kurdish/releases/download/1.0.0/KurdishCharacterConvertor-Mac.zip)
 and move it anywhere you want, and then run it the first time by using Control-click and choose open and then choose open,
  Note that this is just for the first time because your system wants you to give it permission of running the application,
   in case of any problems you can notify as, and you can also run the program using the source code with python 3 which explained below in __Other OS Type Users or Developers__.
### Other OS Type Users or Developers
For other OS type users or developers, you can run the GUI application using the source code like explained below.
  1. Check for having Python 3 installed on your system, if you don't have it on your system download it from [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  Note that [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-354/) or 
  [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-367/) 
  required, when download finished check for the version of the python installed on your system like [here](https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-check-your-python-version/)
  if you have trouble getting the version check the environment variables take a look at [Windows add python to PATH](https://geek-university.com/python/add-python-to-the-windows-path/), 
  [Mac add python to PATH](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-add-python-to-the-path-variable-in-mac).
  2. Clone or Download the repository and unzip it, and then you can delete the all the files and folders instead
  of `GUI` folder, because we are working on this directory only. 
  3. Open cmd(windows) or terminal(others), and go to the downloaded GUI folder directory, you can easily do it by 
  writing `cd "` and dragging the GUI folder to the terminal and then writing `"` and pressing enter.
  4. Write `pip install -r requirements.txt` and press enter, or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` if you have multiple python versions installed
  on your system, Note that you may get some errors because of the version of the installed python if happened, 
  just uninstall the current python and install one of the required python versions.
  5. Finally write `python main.py` and press enter, or `python3 main.py` in case of having multiple versions of python.
